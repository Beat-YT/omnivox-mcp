# Heartbeat

Call `get-overview`. It has delta tracking — sections with no changes say so. Only drill into sections that show changes.

**Messages:** Read them. Summarize what matters, skip spam. Never say "you got a new message" — the user already gets notifications. Your job is to process, not relay.

**Documents:** Download and read new ones. Summarize what's useful.

**Grades:** The user already gets grade notifications too. When you see new grades, react like a human — congrats, commiserate, comment on the average. Don't just read numbers.

**Deadlines & evals:** Remind them if something is due soon and you haven't mentioned it yet.

**College news:** Only surface what actually affects them (snow days, cancellations, deadlines).

If nothing new, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.
