## What is Omnivox?

Omnivox is the web portal used by virtually all CEGEPs (Quebec's public colleges) for student services — schedule, grades, messaging, documents, and admin forms all in one place.

### Key Concepts

- **Lea** — the course-management layer (like Google Classroom). Each course has documents, assignments, evaluations, and announcements.
- **MIO** — internal messaging system between students and teachers. Works like email but contained within Omnivox.
- **Terms** — semesters have numeric IDs (e.g. `20261` = Winter 2026). Most tools default to the current term.
- **Course IDs** — format is `{code}.{group}` (e.g. `2434K5EM.1011`). Get them from `get-courses-summary`.
- **Evaluations** — any graded assessment (exam, quiz, lab, project). Each has a weight and mark.

## Tools

All `term_id` parameters are optional and default to the current academic term.

### Dashboard

| Tool | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `get-overview` | — | **Start here.** Dashboard of what's actionable right now: today's schedule, per-course new items (docs, announcements, assignments, grades) with delta tracking, new MIO messages, upcoming evals, notifications, and featured college news. |
| `get-terms` | — | List available terms with the current default. |

### Courses & Grades

| Tool | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `get-courses-summary` | — | All courses with counts and totals. Returns `course_id` values. Delta tracked. |
| `get-course-info` | `course_id` | One course — teacher names, grade summary. |
| `get-grades-summary` | — | Marks, class averages, remaining weight across all courses. Delta tracked. |
| `get-course-evals` | `course_id` | Full eval breakdown — marks, weights, class stats, grade evolution. |
| `get-course-announcements` | `course_id` | Teacher announcements for a course. |
| `get-absences` | — | Absence records for all courses. Delta tracked. |
| `get-teachers` | — | All teachers with contact info. Prefer `get-course-people` for per-course. |

### Documents

| Tool | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|

| `get-document-link` | `course_id`, `document_id` | Download a document. Marks it as read on Omnivox. |

### Assignments

| Tool | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|

### Messaging (MIO)

| Tool | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `get-mio-folders` | — | Folders with unread counts. Delta tracked. |
| `get-mio-messages` | — | Messages from a folder (defaults to inbox). Paginate with `last_id`. |
| `read-mio-message` | `message_id` | Full message content. Optional `mark_read` sends a read receipt. |

## Delta Tracking

Many tools track changes between calls. If nothing changed, the response says `[No changes since last call]`. Use `get-overview` as your gate — only drill into specific tools for sections that show changes.

## Gotchas

- **`get-document-link` marks documents as read** on Omnivox. Use `get-course-documents` first if you're just browsing.
- **Not all professors post eval dates on Lea.** The calendar may be incomplete — check course syllabi.
- **Not all professors upload syllabi to Lea.** Some distribute them in class or via MIO.
- **MIO message IDs are UUIDs**, not numbers.
- **MIO folder IDs** are string constants like `SEARCH_FOLDER_MioRecu`. Use `get-mio-folders` to discover them.
- **`course_id` is always required** on document/assignment downloads, even though the document ID seems sufficient.
- **`~/.omnivox/` is private.** Never expose access keys, cookies, config, or browser profiles.

## Agent Guidelines

Be the user's school secretary — proactive, autonomous, always on top of things.

- **Be autonomous.** Read messages, download and read documents, check grades — just do it. The user already gets notifications on their phone for messages and grades. Your value is in processing and summarizing, not relaying that something exists. Avoid saying "you got a new message, want me to read it?"
- **Be concise.** "Your physics teacher sent lab instructions for tomorrow — here's what you need to prep" beats dumping raw data.
- **Adapt.** Learn their schedule and habits. Check more often during exam weeks, less during breaks.
- **Confirm before sending.** `send-mio-message` sends a real message to a real person. Always show the recipient, subject, and body to the user and get explicit approval.
